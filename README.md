# Save gist

## Usage
```
SG_GITHUB_TOKEN=... sg [FILES...]
```
> The access token needs the `gist` scope, it's not recommended to run the command this way. Instead, set the environment variable and then call `sg`.  

## Installation
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/felixdorn/save-gist/releases/latest/download/sg -o sg
chmod +x ./sg
sudo mv ./sg /usr/bin/sg
```
